# Paul Gledhill's Dot Files

## Overview

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This repository contains personal configuration files (often
referred to as dotfiles because they typically start with a dot, like .zshrc or .vimrc) that I
use to personalize and customize my development environment. These dotfiles are managed using
GNU Stow which is downloaded as part of the install.sh script.

I'm looking to support:

- Ubuntu zsh
- MacOS zsh

## Install using Script - Ubuntu/MacOS

bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmgledhill102/dotfiles/main/install.sh`"

## Thanks Shivam Khattar
